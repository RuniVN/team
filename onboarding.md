Welcome on board. First of all, we want to say thanks to all the efforts that you have put in, to finish the all the tests to join us. We are here to build our legacy. We're here to build the tech driven empire. We're here to push the limit of the humanity to the next level. Before we get into the work, you need to prepare something as below to be a good value fit and culture fit in general.

## Machine Setup

We prefer MacOS and Linux for working environment.
